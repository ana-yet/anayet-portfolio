  description:

  story: [
    "My interest in technology started in childhood, but it truly took shape during my school days when I discovered the HTML chapter in the ICT book. That small spark led me to explore coding deeply.",
    "I began my programming journey in October 2024 with C language, and soon after, I transitioned into web development, where I found my real passion. My first project, 'Bangladesh 2.0', built with just HTML and CSS, motivated me to learn more.",
    "Since then, I've mastered the MERN stack and worked with technologies like React, Next.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS. I’ve also gained team experience as a co-leader in a 6-member project called 'AgriSmart', where I managed both front-end and back-end development.",
    "Beyond coding, I love reading, learning from podcasts, and helping others grow in tech. For me, development is not just about writing code — it's about continuous learning, collaboration, and creating something valuable for people.",
